# Terminal Portfolio

This project hosts my personal portfolio built with React and Vite. The interface mimics a command-line terminal where you can explore commands to learn about me, my skills and projects, and how to get in touch.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run ESLint checks with:

```bash
npm run lint
```
